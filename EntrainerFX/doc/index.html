		<h1>Entrainer FX</h1>
			<p>EntrainerFX is a program which generates binaural beat frequencies using sound and animations for the purpose 
			of entraining brain waves.  EntrainerFX is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>
			license - it is free and open source.  It can be obtained from the 
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/entrainer">Entrainer Sourceforge project page</a> and the latest version is 
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/entrainer/files/entrainer">EntrainerFX 5.1.0</a>, released on March 14, 2015,
			requiring a minimum of Java 8 (1.8.0_40) to run.  Version 5.1.0 will be the last feature release prior to replacing all
			Java Swing code with JavaFX controls. 
			Screenshots of older versions of Entrainer in action are
			<a href="running.html">included</a> <a href="animations.html">throughout</a> 
			<a href="loading.html">this</a> <a href="lookAndFeel.html">documentation</a>.
			
			<p>EntrainerFX works best with a set of high quality headphones.</p>
			
		<h2>NOTE:</h2>
			<p>There is a bug in Java 8 that prevents EntrainerFX from starting should any spaces exist in 
			the directory names.  Should the spaces exist the following error is generated: 
			<b>java.awt.IllegalComponentStateException: The dialog is decorated</b>. 
			The work around for this issue is to ensure that EntrainerFX is installed
			into a directory structure with no spaces in the names ie:</p>
			
			<p><b>/Users/MyName/EntrainerFX</b> - good</p>
			
			<p><b>C:/Program Files/EntrainerFX</b> - bad</p>
			
			<p>Thanks to Rich for bringing this issue to my attention.</p>
			
		<h2>EntrainerFX Lite</h2>
		
			<p>
				<a href="entrainerfx-lite.html">EntrainerFX Lite</a> is a Java applet / JNLP program which includes a subset
				of the features included in the EntrainerFX distribution.  The latest Java 7 must be installed and permissions
				granted for the application to run within the browser.  There have recently been some vulnerabilities patched in
				Java 7, and prior to the fixes many browsers and OSs have responded by locking down Java applets.  
				<a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/enable_browser.xml">This document</a> describes how to enable Java in the
				browser.  If you have any concerns about Java in the browser then the full distribution is recommended as the vulnerabilities
				apply only to Java in the browser. Note that this applet will not run on Chrome in Mac OSX as it is a 32 bit browser. 
			</p>

    		<br/>     
			<p>
			The above is an example of the permissions being requested (Firefox).  Not a worry!
			</p>
			
		<h2>EntrainerFX Musings</h2>
			
			<p>Much has changed with release 4.0.0 of EntrainerFX:</p>
			<ol>
			<li><b>A rewrite of the main GUI to use Java FX controls</b></li>
			<li><b>A rewrite of the animation subsystem to use Java FX classes</b></li>
			<li><b>The native JSyn library has been dropped in favour of the pure Java implementation</b></li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Early on in development I considered the possibility of rewriting Entrainer in JavaFX.  At the time however JavaFX
			was too immature to support the functionality I required of it for Entrainer.  With the latest release of JavaFX this
			is no longer true.  As Oracle is attempting to eventually replace Swing with JavaFX it was time to dig in & learn the 
			API.</p>
			
			<p>While I'll always have a soft spot for Swing, it has its weak points.  Based on dated GUI architectures it lacks the
			ability to emulate the modern GUI elements we've come to expect from our smart phones & tablets.  And to be honest, without 
			a decent look and feel over top of it it looks like puppy kack.  Another weakness is its (lack of) support for animations.
			The Trident library is excellent to write the animation portions of the code, but Entrainer's heavy use of animations in Swing
			pushes even the gruntiest of machines to its limits.</p>
			
			<p>And so I rewrote the animation and shimmer portions of Entrainer in JavaFX.  I found there to be a good 40% reduction
			in CPU usage when using the various animations, and they can be used together on a good machine without dragging
			it to its knees.  And after I'd mocked up a prototype using the pure Java JSyn library, I noticed that the annoying
			clicks on the Mac had greatly reduced to the point of being able to remove the 32 bit-only native JSyn libraries from
			the distribution - the final impetus for this new version of Entrainer.</p>
			
			<p>As Entrainer now uses the latest JavaFX, it now requires the latest version of the JRE - at least
			<a href="http://java.oracle.com/javase/downloads/">JRE 1.8.0_40</a>.  It will not run on any earlier versions of Java.</p>
	
		<h1>About Entrainment</h1>
			<p>Brain wave entrainment is about stimulating the brain to resonate at a desired frequency.  The two techniques
	    used by Entrainer to achieve this is through the use of sound and animations.  The lower limit of human hearing is 
	    about 20Hz.  As many of the more interesting states of consciousness occur at much lower frequencies, these 
	    frequencies are generated via binaural beats - two slightly different tones, one in each ear, the difference 
	    being the desired frequency.
	    
	    <p>The following gives a rough overview of the relationship between frequency and conscious state:
	    
	    <ol>
	    <li><b>Beta Waves: 12Hz - 40Hz</b> - associated with active, busy or anxious thinking and active concentration, arousal, cognition</li>
	    
	    <li><b>Alpha Waves: 8Hz - 12Hz</b> - associated with relaxation (while awake), pre-sleep and pre-wake drowsiness</li>
	    
	    <li><b>Theta Waves: 4Hz - 8Hz</b> - associated with dreams, deep meditation, REM sleep</li>
	    
	    <li><b>Delta Waves: 0Hz - 4Hz</b> - associated with deep dreamless sleep, loss of body awareness</li>
	    </ol>
	
		<h1>How Entrainer Works</h1>		
			<p>Entrainer works much like the beat of a drum; the beats and changing colours assist in directing the conscious state
			of the subject.  Binaural beats are generated when two sound waves of different frequencies are played together.  The
			difference between the frequencies of the sounds generates a beat of the same difference in frequency - the entrainment frequency.
			
			<h2>The Purpose of Entrainment</h2>
				<p>The human hearing range reaches around 20Hz at its lower range.  Below that frequency sound cannot be heard.  As described above,
				the human brain resonates at specific frequencies related to one's state of consciousness,
				and the frequency related to these conscious states can extend well below the lower range of human hearing.
				Learning to control one's conscious state can be obtained with activities such as meditation, however the discipline to properly
				perform this activity can be prohibitive.
				
				<p>One can increase one's alertness at higher entrainment frequencies, and conversely one can enter a states
				of deep relaxation (and even sleep) at lower frequencies.  
				
				<p>Learning to control one's conscious state can be of great help with conditions such as ADHD and autism,
				and it is the goal of this project to ultimately create a useful medical tool that can assist with the treatment of
				these conditions.  That, and a fun tool with which to learn control of conscious states!
			
		<h1>Requirements</h1>
			<p>Entrainer requires a minimum of <a href="http://java.oracle.com/javase/downloads/">JRE 1.8.0_40 (Java 8)</a>
	    	to run. To run simply double click the EntrainerFX.jar file.
	    	
	    	<p>Alternatively the 'entrainer.bat' (Windows) or 'entrainer.sh' (Unix/Mac) can be used to start Entrainer.</p>
	
	  <h1>***Warning***</h1>
	  	<p>This program produces flashing animations and binaural beat sound waves.  It should not be used by anyone prone
	    to seizures or related conditions without proper medical supervision.<p>
